    # To assert order, check the method_calls on a managing mock,
    # or ensure calls happened relative to each other.
    # This requires a bit more setup if we want strict ordering of disparate mocks.
    # A simpler check for this test: ensure all were called.
    # For true ordering of _methods_ on the same object, method_calls is easy.
    # For ordering of _global functions_ or methods on _different_ mocks, it's more complex.

    # The current structure of _handle_scan_results_side_effects implies order:
    # try:
    #     report_state_changes(...)
    #     self._enqueue_lost_files(...)
    #     determine_app_restart_actions(...)
    #     self._create_restart_trigger_files(...)
    # except: ...
    # So, if all are called, their textual order in the code implies execution order
    # unless an early one raises an unhandled exception (which other tests cover).

    # We can verify they were all called with expected high-level args
