1. systemd Unit Files (typically installed by an RPM into /usr/lib/systemd/system/)

    exportcliv8@.service

        Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8@.service

        Purpose: The main template service unit for running instances of exportcliv8. (Ref: FR-START-001)

    exportcliv8-restart@.path

        Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8-restart@.path

        Purpose: The template path unit that monitors for .restart trigger files for each exportcliv8 instance. (Ref: FR-RESTART-004)

    exportcliv8-restart@.service

        Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8-restart@.service

        Purpose: The template oneshot service unit activated by the path unit to perform the restart of a specific exportcliv8 instance and clean up the trigger file. (Ref: FR-RESTART-005, FR-RESTART-006)

    datamover.service

        Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/datamover.service

        Purpose: The service unit for managing the Data Mover application. (Ref: DM-GEN-001)

    exportcliv8.target

        Location: /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8.target

        Purpose: A systemd target unit to group all instantiated exportcliv8@.service units. This is useful for overall management and for defining dependencies (e.g., datamover.service starting After=exportcliv8.target). (Ref: DM-FR-START-003 implicitly requires a way to group these for ordering)

2. systemd-tmpfiles Configuration (typically installed by an RPM into /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ or /etc/tmpfiles.d/ if intended
 to be admin-overridable by default)

    exportcliv8-triggers.conf

        Location: /etc/tmpfiles.d/exportcliv8-triggers.conf (as specified in NFR-006) or /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/exportcliv8-triggers.conf (more common for package-provided defaults). Given NFR-006 explicitly mentions /etc/, we'll stick with that.

        Purpose: Configures systemd-tmpfiles to clean up any stale *.restart trigger files in /opt/bit_mover/csv/ on boot. (Ref: NFR-006)

3. Per-Instance Configuration Files (typically in /etc/)

    exportcliv8 instance configuration files:

        Location (Directory): /etc/exportcliv8/

        Location (Example Files):

            /etc/exportcliv8/MAH11.conf

            /etc/exportcliv8/MAH12.conf

            /etc/exportcliv8/MAH13.conf

            ... (one for each instance %i)

        Purpose: Contains instance-specific command-line parameters for exportcliv8, loaded by exportcliv8@.service. (Ref: FR-CONF-001, FR-CONF-005)

4. Credential Files (locations vary based on method chosen)

    Option A: Using LoadCredential= (preferred for sensitivity)

        Location (Directory Structure Example for instance %i): /etc/credstore/exportcliv8@%i/

        Location (Example Files for instance MAH11):

            /etc/credstore/exportcliv8@MAH11/AUTH_TOKEN_U.cred (containing the U token)

            /etc/credstore/exportcliv8@MAH11/AUTH_TOKEN_P.cred (containing the P token)

            (The exact file names inside this directory depend on how LoadCredential= is configured in the service unit, e.g., LoadCredential=AUTH_TOKEN_U.cred:AUTH_TOKEN_P.cred)

        Purpose: Securely stores credentials that systemd injects into the service environment. Permissions must be strictly 0600 root:root or similar. (Ref: FR-CONF-006, NFR-003)

    Option B: Using EnvironmentFile= (less secure for highly sensitive data, but simpler)

        Location (Directory): /etc/exportcliv8/ (could be co-located with other configs) or a dedicated secure directory.

        Location (Example Files):

            /etc/exportcliv8/MAH11.env

            /etc/exportcliv8/MAH12.env

            ... (one for each instance %i)

        Purpose: Contains environment variables (including credentials) to be loaded by the service. File permissions must be strict (e.g., 0600 root:root or 0640 root:datapipeline_group if the service user needs to read it directly, though systemd reads it as root if EnvironmentFile= is used). (Ref: FR-CONF-006, NFR-003)

5. Data Mover Application Configuration

    datamover application configuration file:

        Location: /etc/datamover/app.ini (This is a common convention, e.g. /etc/<appname>/<configfile>. The requirements mention app.ini in DM-GEN-003 and DM-FR-START-002 but don't pin down the exact path. This is a logical choice.)

        Purpose: Configuration for the Data Mover application itself, referenced by datamover.service.

Missing Files?

Your list is quite comprehensive for the direct systemd integration and exportcliv8 specific configurations. The only addition I've made is explicitly listing the Data Mover's own configuration file (app.ini), which is implied by the requirements but wasn't in your initial list of files to be created based on the requirements for exportcliv8 management.

Summary of Files and Locations:

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8@.service

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8-restart@.path

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8-restart@.service

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/datamover.service

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/exportcliv8.target

    /etc/tmpfiles.d/exportcliv8-triggers.conf

    /etc/exportcliv8/%i.conf (e.g., /etc/exportcliv8/MAH11.conf)

    Credential Files (either):

        /etc/credstore/exportcliv8@%i/<credential_name>.cred (e.g., /etc/credstore/exportcliv8@MAH11/AUTH_TOKEN_U.cred)

        OR /etc/exportcliv8/%i.env (e.g., /etc/exportcliv8/MAH11.env)

    /etc/datamover/app.ini
