def safe_delete(path: Path, fs: "FS") -> None:
    """
    Safely deletes a file if and only if it is a regular file.

    This function first uses `fs.lstat()` to verify that the given path
    points directly to a regular file (i.e., not a symlink, directory, or other
    special file type). If this validation is successful, it then attempts to
    delete the file using `fs.unlink(path, missing_ok=True)`.

    If `fs.unlink(path, missing_ok=True)` is called and the file is already gone
    (or if `fs.unlink` itself raises FileNotFoundError, which can happen in some
    race conditions even with missing_ok=True, depending on the FS implementation),
    this function treats it as a successful deletion and completes silently.

    Args:
        path: The Path object representing the file to be deleted.
        fs: An FS object providing `lstat` and `unlink` methods.

    Raises:
        DeleteValidationError: This exception is raised for any failure
            encountered during the validation or deletion process, except for
            FileNotFoundError during the unlink phase (which is treated as success).
            Specific reasons for DeleteValidationError include:
            - The path does not exist or is not accessible during validation (`lstat`).
            - The path points to a non-regular file (e.g., directory, symlink).
            - An OS error or other unexpected error occurs during `fs.lstat()`.
            - An error (other than FileNotFoundError, which is treated as success)
              occurs during `fs.unlink()`. This includes OS errors like
              PermissionError or IsADirectoryError, or other unexpected exceptions.
            The original exception, if any, that led to `DeleteValidationError`
            will be available via the `__cause__` attribute.
